## Introduction

V2 of the React Starter Template for ABP application with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn-ui is ready to use. You can use this template to start your next project. This template uses the Next.js App Directory Structure. It is easy to use and extend.

## Removed DaisyUI

I have removed DaisyUI from the template. I have added shadcn-ui instead of DaisyUI. shadcn-ui provides a lot of components out of the box. You can find the documentation [here](https://ui.shadcn.com/).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.js.org/en/installation)
- [ABP Framework](https://abp.io/)

### Installing Template

Install the ABP React .Net Template

```bash
dotnet new install Anto.Abp.React.Template
```

> Note: This only creates React Application. You need to create an ABP application separately. You can find the documentation [here](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Getting-Started).

### Creating a new project

Create a new project using the template

```bash
dotnet new abp-react -o my-project-name
```

> Note: You can use any name for the project. I used `my-project-name` for this example. keep in mind that the project name should be in kebab case (all lowercase and words separated by hyphens) because it will be used as the name of the packages org name.

### Running the project

```bash
cd my-project-name
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

> Note: You can use any other package manager instead of pnpm. But I recommend using pnpm. It's fast and reliable. Make sure you have ABP application is running before running the app.
