## Intro

ABP team released a new experimental app template with the name "app-nolayers". This is a minimal single project ABP application. They have removed all the DDD projects and provided a simple starting point. This will be helpful for the new developers who are trying out the ABP framework. Developers can learn the ABP framework without the DDD complexities.

## Update the ABP CLI

Make sure you have recent version cli before creating the app. you can also use the following command to update the cli.

```bash
dotnet tool update -g Volo.Abp.Cli
```

## Creating the No Layers app

To create the no layers app run the following command.

```bash
abp new Acme.BookStore -t app-nolayers
```

This will create the Bookstore app as a single project application.

## Run the migrations

Navigate to the `Acme.BookStore` folder. Since this is the no-layers application there is no migrations project. To run the migration add the "--migrate-database" cli argument

```bash
dotnet run --migrate-database
```

This will add the migrations and seed the database for you. Database will add the `admin` user and the required permissions.

## Running the app

To run the app use `dotnet watch` or `dotnet run`.

You will see a empty app running.

This app has all the modules of the normal abp application. you have IdentityServer configured as well.
