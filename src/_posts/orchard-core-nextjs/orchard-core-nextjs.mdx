## Introduction

In this series we will see how to setup Orchard Core and Nextjs. We will also see how to use Orchard Core features such as Authentication, Content Types, Content Queries, Swagger, Widgets, GraphQL.

## Why?

I was looking for Headless CMS for my project and after testing few CMS in the .Net space I found Orchard Core. I was impressed with the features and the community. I decided to use Orchard Core for my project. I was also looking for a way to use React with Orchard Core. I found a few articles on the internet but they were not helpfull. I decided to write this series to help others who are looking for the same.

## What are we going to build?

We are going to build a simple Task Management Application called "Tasky". While building the application we will see how to use Orchard Core features such as Authentication, Content Types, Content Queries, Widgets, GraphQL etc. We will also see how to use Nextjs to build the frontend of the application. This will be a simple application with basic CRUD operations. We will not be building a complex application. We will be using Orchard Core as a Headless CMS and Nextjs as a frontend framework. 

## Orchard Core

Orchard Core is a modular, multi-tenant, open source application framework built with ASP.NET Core, that provides a content management system (CMS) with a composition of features that can be used out of the box or extended to suit your needs. Orchard Core is a cross-platform framework, so it can run on Windows, Linux or macOS. Orchard Core is also a headless CMS, so it can be used to build any kind of application, from simple websites to complex web applications. Orchard Core is a community project, and it is released under the Apache 2.0 license. Orchard Core is a fork of Orchard CMS, which was released under the MIT license. You can find more info on [GitHub](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore).

## React

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications. However, React is only concerned with rendering data to the DOM, and so creating React applications usually requires the use of additional libraries for state management and routing. Redux and React Router are respective examples of such libraries. you can find more info on [GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react).

## Next.js

Next.js is a React framework for production. It enables React based web applications functionalities such as server-side rendering and generating static websites for React based web applications. Next.js is a framework for building React applications. It is a wrapper around React that provides a number of features that make it easier to build React applications. Next.js is a framework for React that enables functionality such as server-side rendering and generating static websites. Next.js is a framework for React that enables functionality such as server-side rendering and generating static websites. you can find more info on [GitHub](https://github.com/vercel/next.js).
