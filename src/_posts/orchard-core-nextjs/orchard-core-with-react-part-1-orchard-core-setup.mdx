## Introduction

In this post, I will setup Orchard Core as Headless CMS with a Module.

## Setup

### Install Orchard Core .Net template

```bash
dotnet new install OrchardCore.ProjectTemplates::1.5.0
```

> Note: You can find the latest version of the template [here](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OrchardCore.ProjectTemplates/).


### Create a new Orchard Core project

```bash
dotnet new occms -n Tasky -o Tasky
```

This will create a new Orchard Core project with the name Tasky and the output folder Tasky. 

### Add a new Module

```bash
dotnet new ocmodule -n Tasky.Module -o Tasky.Module
```

This will create a new Orchard Core module with the name Tasky.Module and the output folder Tasky.Module.

### Create Solution for the projects

```bash
dotnet new sln -n Tasky
```

This will create a new solution with the name Tasky. It is not necessary to create a solution, but it is a good practice to have a solution for all the projects.

### Add projects to the solution

```bash
dotnet sln Tasky.sln add *.csproj
```

This will add all the projects to the solution.

### Add a reference to the module project

```bash
dotnet add Tasky/Tasky.csproj reference Tasky.Module/Tasky.Module.csproj
```

This will add a reference to the module project in the main project. It is necessary to add a reference to the module project in the main project, otherwise the module will not be loaded. 

> Note: You need to enable the module in the admin panel. The module will be loaded, but it will not be enabled. check the features section in the admin panel to enable the module.

### Run the project

```bash
cd Tasky
dotnet run
```

This will run the project. On the first run, you will see a setup page. You have to provide the database connection string and the admin user credentials along with the site name. Once you have provided the details, the setup will be completed and you will be redirected to the admin panel.
