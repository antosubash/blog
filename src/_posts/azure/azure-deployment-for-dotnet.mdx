## Introduction

Azure Deployment for .Net is a collection of articles that will help you to deploy your .Net application to Azure. I usually self-host most of my apps in Hetzner Cloud, but I also have some apps running in Azure. I have been using Azure for a long time but there is no collection of articles that I can refer to when I need to deploy a new app. So I decided to create this collection of articles to help me and others to deploy .Net apps to Azure.

## Prerequisites

- [Azure Account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/)
- [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
- [GitHub Account](https://github.com)

## Azure Deployment for .Net

There are many ways to deploy your .Net application to Azure. I want to write about few of them that I have used in the past.

- [Azure App Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/overview)
- [Azure Kubernetes Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/)

## Azure App Service

Azure App Service is a fully managed web hosting service for building web apps, mobile back ends, and RESTful APIs. It is a platform as a service (PaaS) offering of Microsoft Azure. It is a highly scalable service that allows developers to deploy their applications to Azure without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. It supports many languages and frameworks, including .NET, Node.js, Python, Java, PHP, Ruby, and Go. It is a great service for hosting your .Net application.

## Azure Kubernetes Service

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is a managed container orchestration service, based on the open source Kubernetes system, which is available on the Microsoft Azure public cloud. Azure Kubernetes Service is used to deploy and manage containerized applications more easily and efficiently. Azure Kubernetes Service offers serverless Kubernetes, an integrated continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) experience, and enterprise-grade security and governance. Unite your development and operations teams on a single platform to rapidly build, deliver, and scale applications with confidence.

## Other Azure Deployment

There are many other ways to deploy your .Net application to Azure and I will be writing about them in the future. I will be adding the links to the articles here.

## Conclusion

I hope this collection of articles will help you to deploy your .Net application to Azure. If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to comment below and let me know.
