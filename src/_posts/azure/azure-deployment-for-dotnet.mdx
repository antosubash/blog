## Introduction

Azure Deployment for .Net is a collection of articles that will help you to deploy your .Net application to Azure. I usually self-host most of my apps in Hetzner Cloud, but I also have some apps running in Azure. I have been using Azure for a long time but there is no collection of articles that I can refer to when I need to deploy a new app. So I decided to create this collection of articles to help me and others to deploy .Net apps to Azure.

## Prerequisites
