## Why?

Most of the time, I deploy my .Net apps to Hetzner Cloud. I have written a collection of articles on how to deploy .Net apps to Hetzner Cloud. But When I do consulting work, I deploy the apps to Azure because most of the clients are using Azure. I have been using Azure for a long time but there is no collection of articles that I can refer to when I need to deploy a new app. So I decided to create this collection of articles to help me and others to deploy .Net apps to Azure.

## Who is this for?

To be frank this is for me. I am creating this collection of articles for myself. But I am sure this will help others as well. If you are a .Net developer and want to deploy your .Net application to Azure, this collection of articles is for you. There are many ways to deploy your .Net application to Azure. I will be writing about few of them that I have used in the past. I will be adding the links to the articles here as I write them. If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to comment below and let me know.

## Azure Deployment for .Net

There are many ways to deploy your .Net application to Azure. I want to write about few of them that I have used in the past.

- [Azure App Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/overview)

## Azure App Service

Azure App Service is a fully managed web hosting service for building web apps, mobile back ends, and RESTful APIs. It is a platform as a service (PaaS) offering of Microsoft Azure. It is a highly scalable service that allows developers to deploy their applications to Azure without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. It supports many languages and frameworks, including .NET, Node.js, Python, Java, PHP, Ruby, and Go. It is a great service for hosting your .Net application.

## Azure Kubernetes Service

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is a managed container orchestration service, based on the open source Kubernetes system, which is available on the Microsoft Azure public cloud. Azure Kubernetes Service is used to deploy and manage containerized applications more easily and efficiently. Azure Kubernetes Service offers serverless Kubernetes, an integrated continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) experience, and enterprise-grade security and governance. Unite your development and operations teams on a single platform to rapidly build, deliver, and scale applications with confidence.

## Other Azure Deployment

There are many other ways to deploy your .Net application to Azure and I will be writing about them in the future. I will be adding the links to the articles here.

## Conclusion

I hope this collection of articles will help you to deploy your .Net application to Azure. If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to comment below and let me know.
