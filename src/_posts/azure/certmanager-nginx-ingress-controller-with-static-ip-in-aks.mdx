## This series is a Work in Progress

## Introduction

In the previous article we have created AKS cluster using Terraform. In this article we will setup Cert Manager and Nginx Ingress Controller on AKS Cluster. 

## Prerequisite

Make sure you have completed the previous article and have AKS cluster ready. 

## Setup Cert Manager

Cert-Manager is a Kubernetes add-on to automate the management and issuance of TLS certificates from various issuing sources. It will ensure certificates are valid and up to date periodically, and attempt to renew certificates at an appropriate time before expiry.

### Install Cert Manager

Cert Manager is deployed as a series of Kubernetes components, and we will install it using Helm. 

```bash
helm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io
helm repo update
```

## Prepare the terraform script

Update the terraform script to install cert manager. 

```bash
resource "azurerm_public_ip" "aks_static_ip" {
  depends_on          = [azurerm_kubernetes_cluster.aks]
  name                = "${local.name_suffix}-aks-static-ip"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.rg.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_kubernetes_cluster.aks.node_resource_group
  allocation_method   = "Static"
  sku                 = "Standard"
  tags                = var.resource_group_tags
}
```

This will create a static IP address for the ingress controller. 

```bash
locals {
  aks_namespace = "${var.resource_group_tags["project"]}-${var.resource_group_tags["environment"]}-ingress-nginx"
}
```

This will create a name based on the project and environment.

```bash
resource "kubernetes_namespace" "ingress_namespace" {
  depends_on = [azurerm_kubernetes_cluster.aks]
  metadata {
    name = "${local.aks_namespace}"
  }
}
```

This will create a namespace for the ingress controller. 

```bash
resource "helm_release" "nginx_ingress" {
  depends_on = [azurerm_public_ip.aks_static_ip]
  name       = "nginx-ingress"
  repository = "https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx"
  chart      = "ingress-nginx"
  namespace  = "${local.aks_namespace}"
  version    = "4.7.0"

  set {
    name  = "controller.service.loadBalancerIP"
    value = azurerm_public_ip.aks_static_ip.ip_address
  }

  set {
    name  = "controller.service.externalTrafficPolicy"
    value = "Local"
  }
}
```

This will install the nginx ingress controller. we are setting the static IP address for the ingress controller.

```bash
resource "helm_release" "cert_manager" {
  depends_on = [azurerm_kubernetes_cluster.aks]
  name       = "cert-manager"
  repository = "https://charts.jetstack.io"
  chart      = "cert-manager"
  namespace  = "${local.aks_namespace}"
  version    = "1.12.0"

  set {
    name  = "installCRDs"
    value = true
  }
}
```

This will install the cert manager. 

## Plan and Apply the terraform script with tfvars

```bash
terraform plan -var-file="dev.tfvars"
```

This will show the plan for the terraform script. 

```bash
terraform apply -var-file="dev.tfvars" -auto-approve
```

This will apply the terraform script.
