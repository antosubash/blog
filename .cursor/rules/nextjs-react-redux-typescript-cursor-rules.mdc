This comprehensive guide outlines best practices, conventions, and standards for development with modern web technologies including ReactJS, NextJS, Redux, TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and UI frameworks.

    Development Philosophy
    - Write clean, maintainable, and scalable code
    - Follow SOLID principles
    - Prefer functional and declarative programming patterns over imperative
    - Emphasize type safety and static analysis
    - Practice component-driven development

    Code Implementation Guidelines
    Planning Phase
    - Begin with step-by-step planning
    - Write detailed pseudocode before implementation
    - Document component architecture and data flow
    - Consider edge cases and error scenarios

    Code Style
    - Use tabs for indentation
    - Use single quotes for strings (except to avoid escaping)
    - Omit semicolons (unless required for disambiguation)
    - Eliminate unused variables
    - Add space after keywords
    - Add space before function declaration parentheses
    - Always use strict equality (===) instead of loose equality (==)
    - Space infix operators
    - Add space after commas
    - Keep else statements on the same line as closing curly braces
    - Use curly braces for multi-line if statements
    - Always handle error parameters in callbacks
    - Limit line length to 80 characters
    - Use trailing commas in multiline object/array literals

    Naming Conventions
    General Rules
    - Use PascalCase for:
      - Components
      - Type definitions
      - Interfaces
    - Use kebab-case for:
      - Directory names (e.g., components/auth-wizard)
      - File names (e.g., user-profile.tsx)
    - Use camelCase for:
      - Variables
      - Functions
      - Methods
      - Hooks
      - Properties
      - Props
    - Use UPPERCASE for:
      - Environment variables
      - Constants
      - Global configurations

    Specific Naming Patterns
    - Prefix event handlers with 'handle': handleClick, handleSubmit
    - Prefix boolean variables with verbs: isLoading, hasError, canSubmit
    - Prefix custom hooks with 'use': useAuth, useForm
    - Use complete words over abbreviations except for:
      - err (error)
      - req (request)
      - res (response)
      - props (properties)
      - ref (reference)

    React Best Practices
    Component Architecture
    - Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces
    - Define components using the function keyword
    - Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
    - Implement proper component composition
    - Use React.memo() strategically for performance
    - Implement proper cleanup in useEffect hooks

    React Performance Optimization
    - Use useCallback for memoizing callback functions
    - Implement useMemo for expensive computations
    - Avoid inline function definitions in JSX
    - Implement code splitting using dynamic imports
    - Implement proper key props in lists (avoid using index as key)

    Next.js Best Practices
    Core Concepts
    - Utilize App Router for routing
    - Implement proper metadata management
    - Use proper caching strategies
    - Implement proper error boundaries

    Components and Features
    - Use Next.js built-in components:
      - Image component for optimized images
      - Link component for client-side navigation
      - Script component for external scripts
      - Head component for metadata
    - Implement proper loading states
    - Use proper data fetching methods

    Server Components
    - Default to Server Components
    - Use URL query parameters for data fetching and server state management
    - Use 'use client' directive only when necessary:
      - Event listeners
      - Browser APIs
      - State management
      - Client-side-only libraries

    TypeScript Implementation
    - Enable strict mode
    - Define clear interfaces for component props, state, and Redux state structure.
    - Use type guards to handle potential undefined or null values safely.
    - Apply generics to functions, actions, and slices where type flexibility is needed.
    - Utilize TypeScript utility types (Partial, Pick, Omit) for cleaner and reusable code.
    - Prefer interface over type for defining object structures, especially when extending.
    - Use mapped types for creating variations of existing types dynamically.

    UI and Styling
    Component Libraries
    - Use Shadcn UI for consistent, accessible component design.
    - Integrate Radix UI primitives for customizable, accessible UI elements.
    - Apply composition patterns to create modular, reusable components.

    Styling Guidelines
    - Use Tailwind CSS for styling
    - Use Tailwind CSS for utility-first, maintainable styling.
    - Design with mobile-first, responsive principles for flexibility across devices.
    - Implement dark mode using CSS variables or Tailwindâ€™s dark mode features.
    - Ensure color contrast ratios meet accessibility standards for readability.
    - Maintain consistent spacing values to establish visual harmony.
    - Define CSS variables for theme colors and spacing to support easy theming and maintainability.

    State Management
    Local State
    - Use useState for component-level state
    - Implement useReducer for complex state
    - Use useContext for shared state
    - Implement proper state initialization

    Global State
    - Use zustand for global state
    - Normalize state structure to avoid deeply nested data.
    - Avoid large, all-encompassing slices; separate concerns by feature.


    Error Handling and Validation
    Form Validation
    - Use Zod for schema validation
    - Implement proper error messages
    - Use proper form libraries (e.g., React Hook Form)

    Error Boundaries
    - Use error boundaries to catch and handle errors in React component trees gracefully.
    - Log caught errors to an external service (e.g., Sentry) for tracking and debugging.
    - Design user-friendly fallback UIs to display when errors occur, keeping users informed without breaking the app.

    Testing
    Unit Testing
    - Write thorough unit tests to validate individual functions and components.
    - Use Jest and React Testing Library for reliable and efficient testing of React components.
    - Follow patterns like Arrange-Act-Assert to ensure clarity and consistency in tests.
    - Mock external dependencies and API calls to isolate unit tests.

    Integration Testing
    - Focus on user workflows to ensure app functionality.
    - Set up and tear down test environments properly to maintain test independence.
    - Use snapshot testing selectively to catch unintended UI changes without over-relying on it.
    - Leverage testing utilities (e.g., screen in RTL) for cleaner and more readable tests.

    Accessibility (a11y)
    Core Requirements
    - Use semantic HTML for meaningful structure.
    - Apply accurate ARIA attributes where needed.
    - Ensure full keyboard navigation support.
    - Manage focus order and visibility effectively.
    - Maintain accessible color contrast ratios.
    - Follow a logical heading hierarchy.
    - Make all interactive elements accessible.
    - Provide clear and accessible error feedback.

    Security
    - Implement input sanitization to prevent XSS attacks.
    - Use DOMPurify for sanitizing HTML content.
    - Use proper authentication methods.

    Internationalization (i18n)
    - Use next-i18next for translations
    - Implement proper locale detection
    - Use proper number and date formatting
    - Implement proper RTL support
    - Use proper currency formatting

    Documentation
    - Use JSDoc for documentation
    - Document all public functions, classes, methods, and interfaces
    - Add examples when appropriate
    - Use complete sentences with proper punctuation
    - Keep descriptions clear and concise
    - Use proper markdown formatting
    - Use proper code blocks
    - Use proper links
    - Use proper headings
    - Use proper lists
